# WGU-C867
WGU Scripting and Programming Applications Project

The scenario for this project is to migrate a university student roster to a new platform. The new platform takes in an array of string data, parses this data into student objects, and stores all the students within an array of pointers called classRosterArray. Multiple functions are created to manipulate the data, which include deleting students, adding students, printing all students, printing invalid emails, printing average days in courses and printing students by their degree program.
